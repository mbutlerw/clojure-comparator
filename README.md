# Clojure Company Comparator

Just a little closure app I wrote to compare the list of companies on the clojure website with makers hiring partners.

I enjoyed the novelty of using clojure to find companies that used clojure.

## Installation

Clone this repo, will need to include your own list in docs/hiring_partners.txt

Example format:

```
Google
Facebook
Twitter
SpaceX
```


## Usage

```
lein run
=> list_of_companies
```
